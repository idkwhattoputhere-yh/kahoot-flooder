Flood Kahoot games with bots and scare your teachers. This software can send ~2000 bots to a Kahoot game. It is easy to use and doesn't need any installing. The bots can be normal or smart, normal - bots will do nothing, just join, smart - bots will answer questions randomly (max 200 bots will answer because Kahoot has DDOS protection)

<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
